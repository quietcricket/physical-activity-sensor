# Physical Activity Monitoring with ESP8266 and SRF05 Sensor

SRF05 sensor is a ultrasonic based distance sensor.
Aim the sensor to yourself. The distance between your body/head and the sensor will change. 
For one thing, you will know how long you sit in front your computer and work.
How much you move may be related to your work poerformance. (Maybe you surf more Facebook, your body moves less, because you are just reading, not typing).

This is a proof of concept for building a activity/health monitoring for elderlies who always stay at home. The data collected can be fed into an AI model to predict the health condition a few days in advance. 

Will need some button for the user to press to record the day's feeling, productive vs non-productive, healthy vs not healthy.
